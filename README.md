# ResumeAnalyser
The Project: Veridia Resume Analyzer
The project is the Veridia Resume Analyzer, an initiative focused on automating and optimizing the recruitment process through data science.

The core purpose is to take unstructured resume text and transform it into actionable, structured data. This is achieved by building a predictive machine learning model that can instantly categorize a candidate's resume into one of 24 career categories, alongside detailed skill extraction for analytics.

Key Technologies Used
The solution is built using a robust Python stack:

Machine Learning/Prediction: Scikit-learn for the classification model and Joblib for model persistence.

Web Application: Streamlit for the interactive user interface.

Data Processing: Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation.

Text Extraction: PDFPlumber to extract text from PDF resumes.

Natural Language Processing (NLP): NLTK and the re module for text cleaning, stopword removal, and specialized keyword extraction.

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, and the WordCloud library.
